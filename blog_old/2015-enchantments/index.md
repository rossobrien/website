***June 11-12, 2015***

I had weekend plans in Leavenworth, so I decided to sneak up to the Enchantments on Thursday night. Permit season kicked in on June 15th, and I was excited to get a chance to explore the area. I got out of work around 1pm, and arrived at the Stuart Lake trailhead around 4pm. It was a beautiful afternoon for hiking. It was warm and sunny, and a light breeze kept the temperature bearable.

I arrived at Colchuck Lake around 7pm and ate a snack. The lake was crowded and I did not see any open campsites. I decided to head up the pass and camp in the Upper Enchantments. The pass was a tough climb, ascending 2000 feet in a mile. It is a scree slope and finding secure footing is not always easy. Cairns help guide you along the best path, but it is a choose-your-own-adventure climb. The wind increased as I gained elevation, and by time I reached the top at sunset the wind was howling.

The Upper Enchantments are a beautiful, open basin surrounded by mountain peaks. Despite the warm weather, the entire basin was still covered in snow.  I walked for about a half mile looking for a flat spot that wasn’t completely exposed to the wind. I had to settle for a flat rock right off the trail. I struggled to set up my tent in the wind, and used an obnoxious number of rocks to hold it down. I crawled into my tent, put on every article of clothing I had, and attempted to get some sleep.


I got up around 4am. I did not get much sleep thanks to gusting winds, curious mountain goats, and near freezing temperatures. Instead I spent the night staring at the stars through the netting on my tent. I got on trail and enjoyed views of alpenglow as the sun rose over the peaks surrounding the basin.

The upper lakes were all frozen over, so I kept moving fast on the hard snow. As I descended towards Inspiration Lake, I slipped on an icy traverse and slid toward the icy water. I was able to dig in my boots and stop on the shoreline, but the unintentional glissade left me a bit shaken. I took a break for breakfast and filtered some water. I felt much better after eating, and even made some goat friends over breakfast.

The next several miles past the lower lakes went by quick. The snow cover ended as I passed the junction to Prusik Pass. The outlet streams between lakes were all rushing with the snow melt, adding a relaxing soundtrack to the morning. The trail above Lake Viviane resembled a goat path at times. Some places even had rebar set into the rock to help those going up. After some wrong turns, I reached the top of Snow Falls and began my descent towards Snow Lakes.

The trail down Snow Creek was rocky and muddy, and I was glad to be descending instead of ascending. Near the inlet of Upper Snow Lake, I took a break for lunch and a dip in the water. The bugs were annoying, so I didn’t stay long. The trail mellowed out at this point and I was able to cruise the last miles to the trailhead. I passed a lot of climbers and backpackers on their way in, and I did not envy having to do the exposed climb in the heat. I reached the Snow Lakes trailhead around 3:30.
