For the past 6 years, I've used Eclipse as my IDE. It has a great set of
features, but it can definitely be a resource hog at times. So, based on
a recommendation from my buddy Mike
(<a href="https://twitter.com/michaelxor" target="_blank">@michaelxor</a>), I switched to Sublime
Text 2.

Sublime Text 2 is extremely powerful and pretty lightweight. The only
drawback I found from switching is that I could no longer use my
favorite Eclipse theme,
<a href="http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=theme&id=164" target="_blank">feelslikehome</a>. I
tried to make due with one of the default Sublime Text 2 color schemes,
Sunburst, but it just wasn't the same. So, using an awesome <a href="http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">color
scheme editor</a>, I created a color
scheme I really enjoy.

I combined my favorite parts from the feelslikehome theme and the
Sunburst color scheme, and the result was a color scheme I (Github's
random repository name generator) called Laughing Hipster.

I'll probably continue to make tweaks to this as I continue to find
places for improvement (the CSS colors are a little weak right now...),
but if you are interested in using this theme, you can download it from
the <a href="https://github.com/rossobrien/laughing-hipster" target="_blank">Github repo</a>.
