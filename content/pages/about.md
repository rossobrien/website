Hey there! I'm Ross O'Brien. I'm a 25-year old web developer living in the Seattle, WA area.
I graduated from Michigan Technological University in 2011 with a degree in Computer Science (Software Engineering concentration). I use a variety of tools to build fun and useful websites.

I currently work for [Pear](http://www.pearup.com), a website that helps groups and events find sponsorships.

Previously, I worked at [Spartz](http://www.spartzinc.com/), doing all kinds of front-end and back-end projects. While there, I played a large role in developing the websites That's So True and GIFStache.

In my free time, I enjoy playing hockey and ultimate, skiing, and golfing.
