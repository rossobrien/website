***August 17-20, 2015***


This trip almost didn't happen. I had been planning to take a week off in August before club sectionals. Then I went and broke my thumb in our last tournament. It didn't seem prudent to go off into the woods with a cast on my dominant arm. Luckily, my friend Luke was up for the trip, and a couple days backpacking sounded better than attempting to type with one hand.

Luke picked me up around 9AM on Monday and we made the short drive from Seattle to Snoqualmie Pass. We parked at the PCT trailhead near the Interstate, and walked a little over a mile up the road to Alpental and the Snow Lake trailhead. We made quick work of the 4.5 miles up to Snow Lake. After lunch on the shore, we started looking for a campsite. Snow Lake is one of the more popular areas in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, and it was not surprising to find many sites taken, even though it was 1pm on a Monday. We eventually settled for a spot near the Rock Creek trail, which we would be taking in the morning. We set up camp and spent a couple hours exploring the smaller lakes above Snow Lake. I had mac and cheese for dinner and we watched the stars come out before turning in.

I woke up at first light around 5. We packed up camp and hit the trail around 6:30. The Rock Creek trail was supposedly unmaintained, but seemed to be in pretty good shape. We crossed a couple boulder fields, then cruised through the woods until we met the Middle Fork trail. After another mile, we stopped at a campsite near Thunder Creek to eat breakfast. In another mile, we passed signs for Goldmeyer Hot Springs. As nice as a soak sounded, we kept hiking. The gradual uphill (3300' in 13.5 miles) and shaded woods made for easy hiking. We stopped for lunch at Dutch Miller Horse Camp. A hornet landed on my Snickers bar, which I promptly threw into a bush. I avoided a sting, and the Snickers bar somehow stayed clean enough to eat.


The trail became hot and exposed as the afternoon wore on, and our paces slowed. The views became more impressive as we neared the head of the valley. Sheer cliffs rose up on both sides and threatened to crash over the valley like waves. We reached a meadow at the head of the valley and began our final climb up to the Dutch Miller Gap.

We passed over the gap and made the rocky descent to Lake Ivanhoe, our destination for the night. We found a great campsite on a peninsula at the far end of the lake. We did some exploring, ate dinner, and talked breifly with a PCT thru-hiker camping nearby, then went to bed. It was a long day and we were both exhausted.

We slept in a bit on Wednesday, and didn't start hiking until 8AM. We started off with a 2 mile, 1500' descent. We ate breakfast at the intersection with the PCT, and then started a 3.7 mile, 2000' foot climb. The climb was mostly in the shade and ended up being easier than expected. We had great views of Bears Breast Mountain and Waptus Lake on the climb. We passed a good number of thru-hikers, and at the top we chatted with an older hiker for a bit. He was going north, so we were able to get some intel about water sources on the ridge ahead of us. We came upon the water source a mile or so later, and stopped for lunch with a group that was section hiking from Stevens Pass to Snoqualmie.

After lunch we climbed a ridge, rounded a corner, and were met amazing views of Summit Chief Mountain, Overcoat Peak, Chimney Rock, and Lemah Mountain. Our range of vision was full of violent walls and columns of rock flanked by shrinking snowfields. We enjoyed these views along the open ridge as we began our descent.

The trail quickly returned to the woods and turned into a series of absurdly long switchbacks. We finally reached Lemah Meadow at the bottom, and stopped to filter water from a creek. The next couple miles alternated between forest and burned sections. Every water source or potential campsite seemed to have a couple thru-hikers milling about. The last mile and a half to Spectacle Lake gained almost 1200' and was mentally exhausting. In times like these, I like to just put my head down and go. We reached the lake around 7:30 and were able to find a decent spot despite the numerous groups around the lake. We ate dinner and immediately went to bed.

I awoke to pink sunrise coloring the walls of granite surrounding the lake. Clouds were rolling in over the peaks and our neighbors were beginning to stir. We hit the trail around 8 and climbed up a ridge. As we ascended, we had great views down on Spectacle Lake. Near the top of the ridge, we entered into the clouds.

Most of the day was gray and cool as we traversed the ridge on boulder fields and around lake basins. At gaps in the ridge, the clouds would be visibly rushing over the trail. At one point, we came across an abandonded pack and some food. It was in the middle of a boulder field that was almost completely socked in by clouds. It was very surreal and a little concerning. As we hiked on, we debated what to do about it, until some other hikers informed us that a group with a dog had intentionally left it there because the dog could no longer carry it. I felt bad for the dog, but it was a relief to hear that no one was in danger.


We ate lunch above Joe Lake. I broke out the stove and made a warm meal to try and combat the chilly weather. We filtered water a couple miles later at Ridge Lake, which seemed to be a popular break spot for thru-hikers. The clouds began to part as we neared the famed Kendall Katwalk. I was a little disappointed by the Katwalk. I could see it being nerve-racking in bad weather, but in good conditions it seemed pretty standard.

Shortly after the Kendall Katwalk we rounded a bend into an overview of I-90. It was jarring to hear the noise from the traffic after a couple days of peace and quiet. The final descent gave us a couple views of Mt. Rainier, but was mostly just a race to get off my swollen feet. We finally reached the parking lot around 6 and drove straight back to Seattle. My feet were sore and my cast smelled quite funky, but it was worth it for an amazing hike.
